# NdR UI
## This UI is (mostly) inspired by [SoftUI](https://github.com/N-l1/lovelace-soft-ui)

Hello everibody, after some tests I decided to post my UI setup.
This is still a work in progess, so every suggestion is accepted and, of course, you can use this code for your own setup.

The UI is based on two themes: [Clear](https://github.com/naofireblade/clear-theme) and [Slate](https://github.com/seangreen2/slate_theme). Please, refer to [@N-l1](https://github.com/N-l1) instructions to find out how to set up the whole stuff.

Custom cards and Features:

- [Custom Header](https://github.com/maykar/custom-header) (which is acrchived, I'll figure out how to replace it)
- [Layout Card Gridder](https://github.com/kdw2060/hassio-custom-cards/tree/master/layout-card-griddier) (a temporary fork of Layout Card)
- [Card Mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)
- [Button Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)
- [Mini Graph Card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card)
- [Bar Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/bar-card)
- [Light Popup Card](https://github.com/DBuit/light-popup-card) **NEW**
- Security section with Camera Stream Popup **NEW**

The intent was to create a simple and minimalistic UI, with a scalable design (for smartphone and tablets, but also for PC monitors).
I achieved this thanks to Layout Card Gridder, which allows you to set 2 breakpoints and relative cards layout.

Here below some screenshots:
